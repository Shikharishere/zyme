	2. Line Numbers 
	3. Auto Indent -> Indent new line to the same level as the previous line
	4. Copy and paste -> Allow use of ctrl-c to copy and ctrl-v to paste
	5. Config file -> read from a file about set options
	6. Different modes like vim (insert and normal mode)
	7. Use ncurses which is a library that takes care of low level terminal interaction for you....
